## Introduction to BackMyBuild

BackMyBuild is a simple way for builders, creators, and indie hackers to share their work and get backed by their community. No setup, no friction — just enter your wallet address, ENS, Base name, or Farcaster handle, and your page is ready.

Think of it like a **Web3-native Buymeacoffee**. Your profile automatically pulls on-chain data to showcase who you are and how people can support you. Visitors can send tips in any token from any chain, and everything is settled into $USDC on Base for you to receive seamlessly.

### Why BackMyBuild?

* **For Builders:** Create a beautiful profile page instantly. Share your work and receive backing without worrying about setup or payment infrastructure.
* **For Supporters:** Show love directly to builders you admire. Back them with crypto, in one click.
* **For Everyone:** A movement where backing builders becomes as easy as sharing a link.

### Our Vision

We want to create a world where **builders back other builders**.\
BackMyBuild isn’t just about tipping — it’s about making support for creativity and innovation borderless, transparent, and native to the internet we’re all building together.

### Join the Journey

BackMyBuild is built in public, starting from a solo project. You can follow updates, contribute ideas, and be part of shaping how builders support each other in the open.
